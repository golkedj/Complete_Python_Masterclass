1. Select the titles of all the songs on the album "Forbidden".
select title from artist_list where album = "Forbidden";

2. Repeat the previous query but this time display the songs in track order. You may want to include the track number in the output to verify that it worked ok.
select track, title from artist_list where album = "Forbidden";

3. Display all songs for the band "Deep Purple".
select title from artist_list where artist = "Deep Purple";

4. Rename the band "Mehitabel" to "One Kitten". Note that this is an exception to the advice to always fully qualify your column names. SET artist.name won't work, you just need to specify name.
UPDATE artists
SET name = "One Kitten"
WHERE name = "Mehitabel";

5. Check that the record was correctly renamed.
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE _id = 3;

6. Select the titles of all the songs by Aerosmith in alphabetical order. Include only the title in the output.
SELECT title FROM artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith" ORDER BY title COLLATE NOCASE;

7. Replace the column that you used in the previous answer with count(title) to get just a count of the number of songs;
SELECT count(title) FROM artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith";

8. Search the internet to find out how to get a list of the songs fro step 6 without any duplicates;
SELECT DISTINCT title FROM artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith" ORDER BY title COLLATE NOCASE;

9. Search the internet again to find out how to get a count of the songs without duplicates. Hint: It uses the same keyword as step 8 but the syntax may not be obvious;
SELECT count(DISTINCT title) FROM artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith";

10. Repeat the previous query to find the number of artists (which, obviously, should be one) and the number of albums.
SELECT count(DISTINCT artist) FROM artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith";
SELECT count(DISTINCT album) FROM artist_list WHERE artist = "Aerosmith";
